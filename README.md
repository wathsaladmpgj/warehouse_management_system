# Warehouse Management System

## Overview

The Warehouse Management System (WMS) is a robust, enterprise-grade web application designed to streamline warehouse operations, including inventory tracking, outlet management, staff administration, and reporting. Built primarily using Java (Servlets, JSP), it provides a scalable solution for businesses to manage multiple warehouses/outlets, staff, and products efficiently.

## System Architecture

- **Three-Tier/MVC Architecture**
  - **Presentation Layer**: JSP, HTML, CSS for user interfaces and dashboards
  - **Business Logic Layer**: Java Servlets handle requests and business rules

- **Database**
  - MySQL with tables: `admin_register`, `staff_management`, `outlet_details`, `product_pricing`, etc.
